# WTF 

Basically it struck me as interesting that one of the core plot devices in _It Follows_ is a stack. It's wrapped in the whole "sexually-transmitted haunting" thing but it's a stack. The most recently "infected" person, Person A, gets haunted by the ghost. If Person A has sex with someone, Person B, then Person B is now haunted instead of Person A. But if Person B dies, then Person A is being pursued again. 

Really simple diagram where `->` means sexual contact: 

```
A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F
```

Anyway, it's probably obvious. I just started doing this as a joke. Then it turned into an actual thing. Now it
exists, but it doesn't work. I'm ok with that. It was funny doing it. Now of course I'm writing a README for a joke. So.
